	// Enhancement: The first iteration of this contract allow users to contribute
	// by simply calling a function with an integer parameter. Presumably there is
	// a security guard somewhere near the real-world marketplace confirming the deposits
	// are actually made. But there are no on-chain assets underlying the resource market.
	// Modify the code to interface with three real ERC20 tokens called: Water, Wood, and Food.

	// Enhancement: The resource trading logic in this contract is useful for way more
	// scenarios than our simple wood, food, water trade. Generalize the contract to
	// work with up to 5 arbitrary ERC20 tokens.

	// Enhancement: If we are trading real food, wood, and water, we have real-world incentives
	// to deposit ou excess resources. Storage is hard IRL. Water evaporates, food spoils, and wood
	// rots. And all the resources are subject to robbery. But if we are talking about virtual
	// assets, there are no such risks. And depositing funds into the market comes with an
	// opportunity cost. Design a reward system where there is a small fee on every withdrawal, and
	// that fee is paid to liquidity providers.
